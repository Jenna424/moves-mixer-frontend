### **_Description_**

##### The app "Moves Mixer," created for Project 4 of GA's SEIR, enables users to design custom workout routines.

Users can also add equipment requirements to a workout.

##### Navigate to [the deployed site](https://serene-falls-17751.herokuapp.com/) to view workout routines and begin mixing in moves!
